# This is a copy of the Final Project for Programação II

It contains a webpage that is dynamically populated by an <img> containing an art piece (of my liking), a <label> that simulates a plaque and a <p>aragraph that contains a description of the art piece.

It contains a feature where you can click on the image for an audio description of the <p>aragraph.
