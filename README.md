# ProgramacaoII

Files that contain several class exercises from 02 to 15

The file "projeto final" contains the requested file for the Final Project that showcases all skills learned in the module.

This Projeto Final file contains a webapp that is dynamically populated by an <img> containing an art piece (of my liking), a <label> that simulates a plaque and a <p>aragraph that contains a description of the art piece.

It contains a feature where you can click on the image for an audio description of the <p>aragraph.
